\section{Introduction}

This project aims to analyze CPU performance on a single core and multiple techniques that can affect it. For this effect, different algorithms for matrix multiplication algorithms will be implemented and there effects on the processor performance analyzed. The programs used to test the algorithms are developped in Java and C++, for comparison purposes. Performance API (PAPI) enables us to fetch data directly related to the CPU activity, allowing us to better analyze the impacts of the different techniques of matrix multiplication.
