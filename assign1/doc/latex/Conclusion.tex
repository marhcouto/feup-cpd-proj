\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the objectives of the work were achieved as we got to test and prove our hypothesis. To start with, the compiler isn't able to detect some data affinities and at compile time. For instance, the matrix multiplication algorithms prove further optimizations can be done in the code development when it comes to memory management. Not only that but we were also able to detect the improvement \textbf{Multi-line Matrix Multiplication} and \textbf{Block Matrix Multiplication} promess and, through the analysis of the events captured through PAPI, confirm the source of the optimizations lies on the reduction of cache misses that happen on the matrix calculation algorithm.
