\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, in our vision the objectives of the work were achieved as we got to test and prove the thesis that, in the first place the compiler isn't able to detect data affinities at compile time optimizing our code to perform matrix multiplication, and secondly that \textbf{Multi-line Matrix Multiplication} and \textbf{Block Matrix Multiplication} really improve the usage of cache memory resulting in better time performance.
